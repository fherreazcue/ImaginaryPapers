# Title
On the imaginary papers of GitHub training with my imaginary friend Jhon

#Intro
I am lagging behind because I am taking notes.

Now I am adding a citation to Pedro Picapiedra, because I don't want to think much while I take notes.
And now I am edditing to add the other citation, to El Gato con BOtas.

#Method
Jhon Cuerdas is adding stuff to my file... but on his own branch... I wont be able to see this in master, until it is merged.
